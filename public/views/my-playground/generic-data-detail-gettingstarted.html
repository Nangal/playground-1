    <p>
      To help get you started there are some template projects, in the "Templates"" section, that you can use to get started with our APIs.
      You'll need to have Node installed, but once you do you'll be able to have a project running on your local machine in 5 easy steps.
      Simply:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Clone or download a project from the "Templates" section</li>
      <li>Navigate to the new folder and run 'npm install'</li>
      <li>Add the config variable provided below to the resources/script.js file
        <pre>
          <code class="hljs javascript">var config={{connectionConfig}};</code>
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>Run 'node index'</li>
      <li>Open a browser and go to localhost:8000</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Once you're up and running, you can now customize the project or start something new!  Use the field explorer to get a better understanding of the data and determine the names of the fields to use in your project.
        If you create something cool with a Playground data set, <a href="mailto:branch@qlik.com">contact us</a> for submission into the Qlik Playground showcase!
